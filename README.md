If you want to save the output to a .txt file you can:


```bash
python3 image_to_ascii.py > image_example.txt
```

(Notice that you'll have to type blindly as I did not think it through. The image_example.txt will have the initial prompt as well)

## Video to ASCII

A simple video to ASCII converter.

```bash
python3 video_to_ascii.py
```
